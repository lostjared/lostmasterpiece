How to play line up three blocks of the same color in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal line to clear them. Press the arrow keys to move the blocks, press A and S keys
to swap the colors. Clear as many blocks as you can before the grid fills.

This is a old project I wrote many years ago 
the code is not very good but at least it works
was a learning experience, this used to be published on PlanetSourceCode

This project contains 3 make files.

for *nix enviorments, win32, and PSP

Makefile for *nix
Makefile.psp for PSP 

a example to compile:

make -f Makefile
make -f Makefile.win
make -f Makefile.psp

make sure to clean the directory before building for a different platform.

This project also is a older project, so the code is fairly sloppy
it was just 'glued' together and forced to work, but performs fairly 
well in certian circumstances. I believe the PSP version cannot quit.
So certian bugs need to be addressed for PSP before it is ready to have 
a stable build.

This project dependeds on SDL 1.2
